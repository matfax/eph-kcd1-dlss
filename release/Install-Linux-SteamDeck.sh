# DLSS for Kingdom Come: Deliverance @VERSION@ - installer for Steam Deck / Linux (Proton).
#   bash Install-Linux-SteamDeck.sh [game folder]
# Run it from the extracted archive, wherever that is (for example Downloads).
# It finds the game itself: in every Steam library (native and Flatpak Steam, SD cards and other
# drives Steam knows about), else in ~/Games (Heroic, Lutris). A game folder given as the first
# argument wins over all of that.
# What it does (nothing else):
#   1. Checks the game is closed.
@STD@#   2. Copies install/KCDDLSS.asi (the mod), install/KCDDLSS.ini (settings, kept if present),
@STD@#      install/nvngx_dlss.dll (NVIDIA DLSS, kept if present) and install/version.dll (Ultimate ASI
@STD@#      Loader) to Bin/Win64, next to KingdomCome.exe. A version.dll already there is left alone.
@OPTI@#   2. Copies install/KCDDLSS.asi (the mod), install/KCDDLSS.ini (settings, kept if present),
@OPTI@#      install/version.dll (Ultimate ASI Loader) and OptiScaler (install/OptiScaler: OptiScaler.dll
@OPTI@#      and its FSR / XeSS files; OptiScaler.ini kept if present) to Bin/Win64, next to
@OPTI@#      KingdomCome.exe, and sets NgxDll = OptiScaler.dll in KCDDLSS.ini. A different version.dll or
@OPTI@#      OptiScaler.dll already there is left alone.
#      A standalone KCDGrassFix.asi (30 FPS Grass Fix) is renamed to .off: this mod contains it.
#   3. Steam/Proton: adds the line "version"="native,builtin" to the game's Proton prefix
#      (DLL overrides in user.reg, backup kept), so Proton loads version.dll from the game folder.
#   4. Steam: puts WINEDLLOVERRIDES="version=n,b" in front of the game's launch options (the same
#      setting, kept by Steam even if the prefix is reset). Steam has to be closed for this: it
#      rewrites its settings file when it exits. If Steam is running, the installer asks you to close
#      it, or tells you what to type into the launch options yourself. Backup kept.
#   5. Copies the uninstaller to the game folder as KCDDLSS-Uninstall.sh.
# No game file is changed. The mod sets the game up itself at every start (no user.cfg edits).
@STD@# NVIDIA: DLSS runs through Proton's NVAPI bridge (on by default in Proton 9+). AMD / Intel: see
@STD@# OPTISCALER.txt (FSR / XeSS through OptiScaler, not included here).
@OPTI@# OptiScaler is loaded from the game folder: no OptiScaler Proton build needed. See OPTISCALER.txt.
